    "# Data Science Toolbox Assessed Coursework 2: Data at Scale\n",
    "\n",
    "**Deadline:** Wednesday Noon, Week 11\n",
    "\n",
    "## Group Project Description\n",
    "\n",
    "You will choose an application domain that your group will work with for Assessment 2. Your challenge is to apply Massively Parallel Data Science technology to that data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "You should:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Choose an appropriate scientific/analysis question;  \n",
    "- Use an appropriate strategy to learn about the computational performance of the model(s);  \n",
    "- Apply the model(s) to achieve your question.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Appropriate Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Classifiers**\n",
    "- **Neural Networks**\n",
    "  - Auto-encoders\n",
    "  - Choice of Deep Learning platform\n",
    "  - Choice of architecture\n",
    "  - Interpreting Deep Learning decisions\n",
    "- **Text Processing Systems**\n",
    "  - Latent Dirichlet Allocation\n",
    "- **Image Processing Systems**\n",
    "- **Recommender Systems**\n",
    "- **Exploratory Data Analysis**\n",
    "  - Graph visualisation and algorithms on graphs\n",
    "\n",
    "### Appropriate Technologies\n",
    "\n",
    "You may use this opportunity to delve further into:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Algorithmic Approaches**\n",
    "- **Parallelism via GPUs**\n",
    "- **Map/Reduce**\n",

    "### Advice on Assessment\n",
    "\n",
    "You will be assessed on:\n",
    "\n",
    "a) The implementation of the model, that is, you can be awarded credit for:\n",
    "   - Additional implementation if an off-the-shelf implementation falls short.\n",
    "   - Exploring multiple implementations.\n",
    "   - Examining the mathematical details of choices.\n",
    "\n",
    "b) The application of the model to your chosen domain, that is, you can be awarded credit for:\n",
    "   - Identifying an appropriate dataset.\n",
    "   - Using your understanding of the structure of datasets to make arguments comparing the dataset you chose to one that you might encounter in a “real” data-science setting.\n",
    "   - Plotting or otherwise describing various inputs, outputs, or parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "c) The correctness of the methods used to achieve their stated goals.\n",
    "\n",
    "d) The robustness of the results in supporting the conclusions.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to be attributed credit for your efforts to choose appropriate data, ensure that you document the data exploration process. You should aim to demonstrate diligence that there is no more appropriate data source in your chosen category. You do not need to excel in all areas in order to get a high mark. Instead, you need to perform robustly in all areas and additionally demonstrate insight somewhere to score highly. You are not expected to work in a genuine high-volume environment, but you should demonstrate how you expect your method would perform at scale.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Individual Reflection Description\n",
    "\n",
    "- Discuss the rationale behind the inference goal that you selected.\n",
    "- Discuss what changes you might have to make were the volume of data to be increased by a factor of 1000.\n",
    "- Relate your data source to those you might encounter in a real-world setting.\n",
    "- Discuss a mathematical issue raised in the project, different from those of your group."
